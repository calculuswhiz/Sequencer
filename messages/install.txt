[Sequencer - Install Message]
	Thank you for installing Sequencer!

    How it works: generates a sequence using the active edit regions on the open document.
	
	The manual is located here:
		Preferences > Package Settings > Sequencer > README
    
    Sequencer adds two menu commands:
        + `Edit > Text > Generate Sequence (defaults)`
        + `Edit > Text > Generate Sequence (interactive)`  
        
    And adds two palette commands: 
        +  `Sequencer: Generate Sequence (defaults)`
        +  `Sequencer: Generate Sequence (interactive)`
